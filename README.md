Perform various operations on sound waves, such as:
- Adding echoes;
- Implementing a high-pass filter to remove low frequency noise from audio;
- Supporting the discrete Fourier transform operation on a sound wave;
- Comparing two sound waves;
- Grouping music by structural similarity.

Additionally, developed robust testing strategies to achieve 90% code coverage. Wrote method specifications as needed to ensure readability and maintainability of the codebase.
